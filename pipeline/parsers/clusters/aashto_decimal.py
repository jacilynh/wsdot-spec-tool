"""The AASHTO decimal scheme: "105", "105.01", "105.15.2.1" — the national pattern.

Roughly 36 state DOTs organize their standard specifications this way (see
`docs/national/EXPANSION.md`): three-digit Section numbers grouped into hundred-series
divisions (100 = General Provisions, 200 = Earthwork, ...), with dot-delimited decimal
subsections. One profile drives the shared engine for the entire cluster; a state joins
it by pointing its descriptor here, not by adding code.

Confirmed against three states' real 2025-2026 books with zero code beyond this profile:
North Dakota (540 sections, Arial-Bold 13), Pennsylvania (1,430, Arial-Bold 10), and
Missouri (6,777, Times-Bold 8) — three fonts, decimal depths from two to eight levels, and
three- and four-digit section numbers, all recovered in strictly monotonic order with the
catalog's named sections matched exactly. Each book also has ONE idiosyncrasy that stays a
per-state concern rather than leaking into this shared profile:
  * PennDOT numbers a lettered sub-level ("104.06(a)") that appears only in the running
    header, not the body (see the note below the pattern).
  * MoDOT numbers down to titleless paragraphs: its deepest levels ("102.2.1") are numbered
    prose with no heading title, so ~1/3 of Missouri's captured sections hold a sentence
    where a title would be. Whether to keep, collapse, or relabel those is a choice for the
    Missouri build, not something the numbering profile can decide.

Unlike WSDOT, section numbers are NOT guaranteed stable across editions here, so the
history build must fall back to content alignment (`stable_numbers=False`).

Heading depth stops at the decimal subsection (`105.01`) on purpose. WSDOT prints the full
number at its deepest level ("9-03.8(2)A"), so a regex reaches it — but the AASHTO books
don't all behave that way. PennDOT (Pub 408) was checked directly: its lettered sub-level
appears in the body only as a bare "(a) Slurry Management." lead-in, and the full
"104.06(a)" is printed *solely in the running page header* (51 header occurrences vs 3 in
the body across the sample). Extending this pattern to "(letter)" therefore captured no
real subsections there — only a stray header that slipped the band filter. Reaching that
level needs a header-context step (read the running header to learn the current section,
then attach the body's "(a)" lead-ins to it), which is a per-state parser feature, not a
change to this shared profile. So the cluster profile deliberately stops at the level the
body actually numbers.
