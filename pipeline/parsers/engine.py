"""
The scheme-independent parsing engine.

Given a spec PDF and a `SpecProfile`, derive the section tree from typography and
ordering alone — no table of contents, nothing about any one state hardcoded. This is
the machinery that was proven across all 17 WSDOT editions (2000-2026); Phase A lifted
it out of `parse_any_edition.py` unchanged so that other states, whose only real
difference is the numbering scheme, can drive it through a different `SpecProfile`.

`parse_specs.py` (the older, WSDOT-only parser) anchors headings to the PDF's embedded
table of contents. That works on recent editions but not across an archive: older books
ship a 2-entry TOC and mid-era ones only division-level entries. Every edition does have
a clean text layer, so this engine measures the document instead of trusting a TOC:

  1. BODY FONT is the modal (font, size) across all lines. A heading is any line that
     opens with a section number in a font that is NOT the body font. This survives every
     typographic era (heading weight is even unnamed in the newest books — "Lato-Heavy" —
     so weight is learned by contrast, not matched by name).
  2. HEADER/FOOTER bands are the y-coordinates shared by nearly every page's first and
     last line. The running header reprints the section heading verbatim, so it is
     stripped by position — and its position moves between editions.
  3. BODY START is chosen by trying every occurrence of the profile's first section and
     keeping whichever yields the most headings that actually have prose under them. This
     self-corrects for two traps: a front-matter contents listing (a full section run with
     no text under its entries) and supplements that RESTART numbering partway through.
  4. MONOTONIC ORDER: section numbers only ever increase through the body, so anything out
     of order is a cross-reference table cell, not a heading. Taken as a longest
     non-decreasing subsequence, so one spurious HIGH number can't reject the rest of the
     book.

Nothing here knows what a WSDOT number looks like; that is the `SpecProfile`'s job.

    in the margin, separated from the body by a gap larger than the body's line pitch. Some
    books print no running header (FDOT, MaineDOT); their first line is simply the top text
    margin, flowing straight into the body. There the modal min-y is NOT a header — and a
    section heading that opens at the top of such a page must not be stripped as if it were one
    (the FDOT y=72 bug). So after measuring the modal band we check whether it is actually
    separated (median top/bottom gap > SEP_RATIO * pitch on the pages that sit at it); if not,
    the band is dropped to a sentinel and nothing is stripped there. A genuinely separated
