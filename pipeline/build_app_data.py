Emit the JSON the web app consumes, from the parsed editions and the history file.

    uv run --with pymupdf pipeline/build_app_data.py \\
        pipeline/out pipeline/history.json app/public/data

The app is a static site, so all of its data is baked here at build time. The shapes
are chosen so the browser fetches little and lazily:

    index.json            headline stats, division names, and a lightweight list of
                          every current section (num + title + flags) — enough to draw
                          the whole navigation tree and run keyword search, ~250 KB.

    sections/<d>.json     the current (latest-edition) full text of every section in
                          division <d>. Fetched only when that division is opened.

    history/<d>.json      each section's timeline for division <d>: introduced /
                          revised / vacated / removed, and for every revision a
                          precomputed word-level diff against the prior edition, so
                          "what changed in 2008" is a lookup rather than a client-side
                          re-diff of two full texts.

Splitting sections and history by division (9 files each) keeps any single fetch small
and lets the reader page through the book without ever loading all of it.
